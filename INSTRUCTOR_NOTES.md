Compilation of instructions and important things to remember for the different
levels.

# Level 1

- We're going to be building a lot of functionality ourselves.

- Wai
  - A simplistic API framework

- Hackage 
  - Primary repository for Haskell packages.
  - Contains documentation (mostly)
  - Package **Index** is extremely useful for discovering and interrogating
    packages

# Level 2

# Level 3

# Level 4

# Level 5

# Level 6

# Level 7

- structure repo
- what is hackage - important parts on the main page
- readme in each repo
- monoid instance - rehash single/multiple number of possible instances. Don't let people hang too long on this point.
- mention will only be a REST application (no html)
- how to find the documentation for the Header / ContentType
- more instruction that lead people to hackage documentation for Text/ByteString etc
- mention that import lists may need to be updated for the new types
- some editors will need to jump in and out of the different levels (close, cd, re-open)
- level05: Hardcode db name, once they have it running then add it to the config
- Mention that it's fine to use case statements for Either handling, we make it okay at the end.
- Call out the encoding instances & the automatic deriving of the ToJSON instances
